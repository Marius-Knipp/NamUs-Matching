Except for where the fabric is attached to the waistband and one stitch at the bottom of the fly all of the other stitching is complete degenerated.  The fabric is very worn but intact except for only three small defects on the posterior aspect, the largest of which measures 1/2 inch.  None of these defects are suspicious for cut marks.
A pair of corduroy pants have been reduced to threads except for pocket linings and the corduroy fabric immediately surrounding the rusted metal zipper and metal fastener at the waist on which is written the word “Cowden”.  There is a label with red stitching reading “Cowden Since 1919 Made In USA” attached to the threads.  Another small label reading “Cowden” is incorporated in some residual black stitching attached to the threads of the fabric.  Some of the stitching of the pockets has degenerated.  There are many dried sticks caught up in the threads of this material.
A 11 inch long, complete, leather sole from a right shoe including a 1/2 inch high heel has multiple small nails along its edges.  Two separate remnants of very worn, dirt stained, dense leather material include a remnant containing a few similar nails and one rounded edge which appears to have been stitched.  It measures 6 inches in greatest dimension.  The second remnant measures 9 inches in greatest dimension and includes some small islets near a stitched edge as well as the portion of the shoe which was nailed to the sole.

His jacket bore a patch from the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture. The name of the agency was changed to the Natural Resources Conservation Serivce in 1994, but they still use the same logo that’s on his patch. Also, his hat is from an outfit out of Sedona, AZ that does ropes training for wilderness rescue (http://www.ropesthatrescue.com/). It looks like a relatively small business, and they don’t seem to sell their logo gear online—the only folks on their website wearing the hats are their staff—OD water bottle, shampoo bottle, left shoe, red sleeping bag, nasal solution bottle, red long sleeve shirt, deodorant, sunglasses, compact mirror, green plaid jacket, sock, blue underwear, tan ball cap, shorts with belt, solar light, water jug, Chapstick, green jacket, canvas bag with contents socks, grey t-shirt, black garbage bag, green cup, sock, nylon bag, sunglasses, belt, and shoelaces

Several loose teeth are found on this garment.  The shirt is completely buttoned-up but is inside out.  A stylized ""G"" logo at left front breast is consistent with the logo of the Greeneville Flyboys (formerly the Greeneville Reds), a minor league baseball team out of Tennessee.  A large number ""3"" is on the back.  There are no obvious holes in this garment.
A short-sleeved shirt (George brand, size 2XL) is found on top of the torso.  The raglan sleeves are red while the rest of the shirt is dark gray.  The forearms are partially inside the sleeves and the decedent may have been wearing this shit.  The shirt may have ridden up during movement/transport, and since the head is separated from the torso, the shirt may have slipped forward, displacing onto the torso where the forearms remained inside.  Referral to original scene photos may clarify this.  There is a 3-centimeter wide, triangular-shaped hole near the lower left front hem.

The decedent is wearing heavily decomposed denim pants (Lee brand, original color is gray?).  No size label is found, and the waistband is too degraded to measure waist size.  The top button is undone and the zipper is half-way down.  Three mini bottles of Jim Beam whisky are found in the rear left pocket.  One cigarette butt is found in the right front pocket.  The fabric of the pants tightly adheres to the skin on the legs and easily tears.
The decedent is wearing Nike Monarch athletic shoes, white with blue trim (US size 11).  The left shoestring is loosely tied, while the right shoestring is not tied.  Tread wear on the soles indicates the wearer chronically inverted their feet while walking (weight was placed on the outer edges of the feet rather than evenly across the sole of the feet).  This wear pattern is slightly more evident on the right shoe.  Both feet are encased in greenish-yellow ankle socks with patterned grips on the soles.  Such socks are commonly distributed in jails and hospitals.","Other distinctive physical characteristic: If antemortem imaging of the skull is found, a positive identification can be made by matching vault suture patterns, meningeal vessels, frontal sinus pattern, and the antemortem fracture to the right side of the decedent's head.  Antemortem chest x-rays could be used to match the cervical ribs and other unique skeletal traits found on this individual to include an ossified thyroid cartilage, a medially curved right clavicle (due to the cervical rib complex?), and a long sternum with an ossified xyphoid process.  Antemortem dental records would also provide a quick identification."
